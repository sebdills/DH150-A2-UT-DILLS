## Introduction

Etsy.com is a website that specializes in selling vintage and custom made clothes, jewelry, craft supplies and home decor. It’s site design is very similar to a lot of e-commerce sites, but it specifically allows for a great deal of interaction between independent sellers and site users (buyers). 

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on the Etsy.com website several usability concerns emerged. Firstly and most importantly, the overall website is extremely cluttered and inconsistent in it’s conventions and style. It makes it difficult to differentiate ads from normal results. Generic labeling makes distinguishing categories and predicting what function different buttons on the website serve extremely difficult. Overall the site needs to be cleaned up and simplified. 

With these points in mind I will be conducting a usability test to determine to what extent these problems hinder the user experience. The test is designed to test how effective, efficient and satisfactory the Etsy website is. I designed three common tasks that require users to make use of the basic functionality of the website. I also compiled a list of questions to test how the design of the website appeals to users and if it matches their preconception of how the website works. The final goal is to find any points of growth with the design of the website and compare the findings of the heuristic evaluation and the usability test. The most important information will be in regards to how users see and interact with the website from their own perspective. 

## Methodology

The pilot usability test will be conducted in a quiet outdoor space in order to best accommodate COVID-19 guidelines. The moderator (I) and the subject will sit next to each other at a table. I will record the user's screen, voice and face via Zoom as  they complete the survey. 
The moderator will start by introducing the survey process to the participant. After giving informed consent, we will move on to a pre-test questionnaire which is meant to capture the first impressions the user has of the Etsy website. Following this user will attempt the three tasks while sharing their thoughts out loud. Following the three tests, the survey participant will answer post-test questions about their experiences attempting each task. This will capture the participant's experience and opinions in terms of the site’s ease of use, aesthetic and efficiency. In addition to this it will gauge their opinions on if they would use the site in their own time/incorporate it into their life.

## Reflection

A lot of the thoughts I had following the heuristic evaluation were confirmed during the usability test. 

The most glaring issues the patient pointed out was how cluttered the interface was, how a lot of the concepts were unclear and certain filters lacked specificity. During the first task she was able to navigate to the shop quickly and without error despite having a typo in the name of the store (period at the end). She was also able to find the reviews without any issues. She did have some trouble finding and understanding the return policy, but this is likely due to decisions made on the user side (how the shop owner chose to phrase their words). Additionally the participant had trouble differentiating ads and catered content forms actual search results. WHen looking for the most expensive painting on the site the user had quite a bit of trouble because the top row was ads which had different price ranges than the actual search results. For the second task the participant had trouble with the concept of a shop on Etsy and was unfamiliar with the concept. Once this was explained to her the second task was quite easy for her. She ranked the third task as the hardest, the second as the easiest and the first in the middle. 

Overall I was quite surprised with how much the user struggled with certain tasks. I didn't realize how difficult they were when someone had no experience with a site. It was very enlightening to see how small usability issues can make simple tasks difficult. I didn't want to overwhelm the user with questions so I kept them to a minimum and largely stayed on script. I feel like I learned a lot about Etsy's growth points. A lot of this could come down to simply removing some sections and being more consistent in where you find things. The holiday shop includes items that are also found in other areas on the website which was a point of confusion for the UT participant. Overall I'm happy with how the trial went. If I were to do it again I would change the wording of certain questions to be more specific and I would crop the screenshots used to avoid confusion.
